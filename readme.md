# Calender Blocks (Temporary Title) [Prototype]

## What is it?
A user can add a note with a date and a block (card) will be displayed to represent it. As the blocks populate the interface they are arranged in chronological order. A user should be able to delete a block.

## Technology
User input will be through a web page using html forms, posted to a database using SQL commands scripted by PHP. The page will read the database information using SQL commands and generate the content using PHP to create HTML elements. The page will be styled with PHP.

## Why a prototype?
This application will be functional however as a business model it is not suited to scaliablity as we do not have the resources for largescale database hosting or security. A better option for this application in offical implemention would be to generate a local user file to cache the data inputted using client-side scripting.

## Can this make money?
Sure, you could invest in the database capability and collect the information users input, if you implemented a streamlined tagging function this would create insightful aggregates for yearly activity of users. Another option would be to display advertisements on the interface for example recommending activities to users with a 'quick add event' function to book servcies in their area. A third option would be to sell the application as a single purchase or a subscription. Another would be to implement paywall features. My own idea for monetisation I would like to try in applications to release free 'boring' versions, but sell stylish reskins. This means the application should be made for this functionality.
